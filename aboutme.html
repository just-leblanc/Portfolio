                    <h3>My studies</h3>
                    <p>I obtained my Scientific Baccalaureate with honors in 2020. After that, I joined Polytech Clermont-Ferrand for an integrated preparatory class. After this preparation, I chose to specialize in the Maths and Data Sciences program, having already a passion for new technologies.</p>
                    <p>During my studies, I had the opportunity to explore various fields:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Deep Learning</strong>: I studied neural networks and their application in image recognition and natural language processing projects.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li><strong>Machine Learning</strong>: I acquired skills in machine learning algorithms, data analysis, and predictive model creation.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li><strong>Databases</strong>: I learned to design, manage, and query relational and non-relational databases, as well as optimize query performance.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li><strong>Development</strong>: I strengthened my development skills using technologies such as C, C++, Java, Python, and SQL.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This versatile training allowed me to develop a solid foundation of knowledge and technical skills. It is thanks to this diversity of subjects that I was able to discover and cultivate my interest in development, both front-end and back-end. My academic journey provided me with a deep understanding of theoretical concepts and offered numerous opportunities to work on practical projects, thus preparing me to tackle real-world challenges in the field of technology.</p>

                    <h3>Interest </h3>
                    <p> When I'm not coding, I'm probably running or doing strength training. These two activities give me the energy and discipline needed to tackle everyday challenges. I also love diving into books on personal development, novels or Stoicism, which help me broaden my horizons and cultivate a balanced mindset. Here is a quote from Seneque’s book "Letters to Lucilius", which inspires me greatly:</p>
                    <em>"It is not the one who has little but the one who desires more who is poor."</em> 
                    <br>
                    <p>Finally, I dedicate time to deepening my development skills by exploring new technologies and constantly learning. These passions help me stay balanced and motivated, both in my personal and professional life </p>
                    <p> Here is a list of books I have read about personal development or Stoicism: </p>
