                    <p>I am passionate about both front-end and back-end development.
                        This portfolio is a space where I share my projects, whether they are done as part of my studies or personal projects. It serves as a way for me to document my learning journey and showcase my progression as a developer. It also allows me to learn new programming languages such as CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. </p>

        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>My name is Audrey BUFFET, and I am a fourth-year student in the engineering and data sciences program at Polytech Clermont-Ferrand. This course has allowed me to discover a true passion for development, primarily in front-end but also in back-end. It is for this reason that my professional project is oriented in this direction.</p>
        <p>As a curious and perfectionist person, I particularly appreciate the field of development because it offers the opportunity to learn many programming languages. I enjoy spending time on a project to create clean, intuitive, and easy-to-use interfaces.I am always looking for new opportunities to deepen my knowledge and improve my skills. My goal is to contribute to innovative projects and to continue learning and evolving in the field of development.</p>

                <div class="text-content">
                    <p>I obtained my Scientific Baccalaureate with honors in 2020. After that, I joined Polytech Clermont-Ferrand for an integrated preparatory class. After this preparation, I chose to specialize in the Maths and Data Sciences program, having already a passion for new technologies.</p>
                    <p>During my studies, I had the opportunity to explore various fields:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Deep Learning</strong>: I studied neural networks and their application in image recognition and natural language processing projects.</li>
                        <li><strong>Machine Learning</strong>: I acquired skills in machine learning algorithms, data analysis, and predictive model creation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Databases</strong>: I learned to design, manage, and query relational and non-relational databases, as well as optimize query performance.</li>
                        <li><strong>Development</strong>: I strengthened my development skills using technologies such as C, C++, Java, Python, and SQL.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This versatile training allowed me to develop a solid foundation of knowledge and technical skills. It is thanks to this diversity of subjects that I was able to discover and cultivate my interest in development, both front-end and back-end. My academic journey provided me with a deep understanding of theoretical concepts and offered numerous opportunities to work on practical projects, thus preparing me to tackle real-world challenges in the field of technology.</p>
