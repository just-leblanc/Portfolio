            <p>My name is Audrey BUFFET, and I am currently in my fourth year studying Mathematics and Data Sciences at Polytech Clermont-Ferrand. I am passionate about both front-end and back-end development.
                This portfolio is a space where I share my projects, whether they are done as part of my studies or personal projects. It serves as a way for me to document my learning journey and showcase my progression as a developer. It also allows me to learn new programming languages such as CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. </p>
